# **1. Problem Statement**
We are designing a **City Transport Navigation System** that represents a city as a graph where:
- Nodes represent **locations**
- Edges represent **roads**
- Edge weights represent **distances/time**

The system will support:
- BFS (Breadth First Search)
- DFS (Depth First Search)
- Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
- MST (Prim/Kruskal)
- Hashing (mapping city names → node numbers)

---

# **2. Data Structures Used**
### **Graph Representation**
- **Adjacency List**  
  Efficient for sparse graphs.

### **Hash Map**
- Maps city names to integer node IDs.  
- Implemented using `unordered_map<string, int>` in C++.

### **Priority Queue**
- Used in Dijkstra to always select the smallest distance node.

### **Vectors / Lists**
- Store neighbors and weights.

# **3. City Mapping (Hashing)**
We create a mapping of areas:

| City Name | Node ID |
|----------|---------|
| Saddar | 0 |
| Cantt | 1 |
| Gulberg | 2 |
| DHA | 3 |
| Railway Station | 4 |

Mapping is done using hashing.

# **4. System Workflow**
1. Input city names  
2. Convert names → numeric IDs (hashing)  
3. Build graph using adjacency list  
4. User selects:
   - BFS traversal
   - DFS traversal
   - Shortest Route (Dijkstra)
   - Minimum Cost Network (MST)
5. Output results

# **5. Algorithms Used**
- BFS → Level-wise traversal  
- DFS → Depth-first traversal  
- Dijkstra → Shortest weighted route  
- MST → Minimum cost city connectivity  

---

# **6. Expected Results**
- City graph built successfully  
- Paths and distances computed correctly  
- MST shows minimum cost network  
- Hashing shows efficient mapping

# **7. Conclusion**
This system demonstrates **practical use of graph algorithms** and hashing to build a working navigation model for transport networks.
