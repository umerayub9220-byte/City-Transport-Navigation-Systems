# Kaizen Improvement Review – Week 3

| What Was Built | Problem / Limitation Found | Improvement Idea | Team Member Responsible | Expected Impact |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm | Path was correct but lacked route visualization clarity | Added parent tracking and full path display | Umer Ayub | Improved user understanding of shortest routes |
| BFS Reachability Feature | Did not handle invalid start stop gracefully | Added stop existence validation | Umer Ayub | Prevents runtime confusion and invalid input issues |
| Priority Queue Usage | Performance drops with unnecessary reprocessing | Added distance check before expansion | Umer Ayub | Faster execution and optimized performance |
| Console Output | Outputs were hard to read | Added symbols and structured output | Umer Ayub | Better user experience and readability |

## Kaizen Summary
Small continuous improvements were applied after testing edge cases.  
Focus was on **algorithm correctness**, **performance**, and **user clarity**.
